## ðŸ›° Long-run SLAM robustness for warehouse robots
**Role:** SLAM Engineer @ Prime Robotics  
- Stabilized localization over 30â€“60k sq ft with dynamic obstacles.  
- Removed a mutex bottleneck in visualization that throttled ICP; reduced drift and improved stability.  
- Pose-graph tuning for higher map integrity.
